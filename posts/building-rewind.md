Over the weekend, my teammates and I built Rewind, an immersive 3D web application that allows users to experience the history of Singapore in a more interactive manner. We were inspired by a project from [Hack For Public Good 2025](https://www.hack.gov.sg/2025/public-asset/), which aimed to modernise the National Archives. Halfway through the hackathon, we realised that we could also allow users to upload their own images and create a digital scrapbook to reminisce about their memories.

## Technologies we used:

- **Exa's** smart search system
- **Google's Gemini 2.5** to synthesise the information gathered into a concise yet informative description
- **OpenAI's Text-To-Speech** to narrate the description
- **Google's Nano Banana model** to upscale and colourise the images
- **Single-image High-fidelity Appearance Reconstruction with Primitives (SHARP)** model to generate a high-fidelity and immersive 3D experience for the user.
- **React** for the frontend
- **Cloudflare's** data storage (images and audio)
- **Supabase's** database for keeping a record of generated images and text
