# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post on my newly revamped personal website! 
I've always wanted a place to share my thoughts and also showcase my projects, which is why I created this site. This blog post (and probably the next few, if I even decide to continue posting) is probably going to be pretty rough, as I'm trying to write it from scratch and just jot down my ideas as they flow through me.

It seems like the writing capibilities of most have been declining in recent years, ever since the widespread adoption of AI models like ChatGPT. We've offloaded more and more of our thinking and writing skills to these technologies. In fact, I've on occassion offloaded the task of writing simple emails to ChatGPT, not because I didn't know how to but simply as I wanted to offload the cognitive workload associated with writing. That's something that I could've done with ease even when I was like 9 years old. Hence, I'm trying to make a conscious effort to reduce that reliance on technology and improve or at least maintain my own writing abilities. Maybe I'll still use technology to enhance my writing, in the form of spell check or grammar fixes, but the main intention is for it not to replace my thinking.

Why specifically writing then? Writing is one of the main ways to communicate your ideas and it's a pity to reduce that to lines upon lines of AI-generated slop with no soul. The AI generated text most of the time also seems to lack the human touch and seems too polished or fancy, which is really not what I like. It also lacks the understanding of what makes me, me, which makes its generation largely generic and easily overviewed. Additionally, writing is also a good way for me to reflect upon my thoughts and ideas, which could propel future novel ideas. Finally, I'm also planning to apply for American colleges and there's the commonly dreaded essays that the Common App has, and also the supplemental essays that some colleges require or adds a boost to your application. Practicing my writing skills either by writing here or on pen-and-paper would improve my ability to convey my thoughts better and hopefully potray myself in a more unique way as compared to many other applicants who simply reply on prompting AI tools for their essays.
